## We have used:
- Ngrok and Flask as a server.
- Twilio as whatsapp agent.
- ChatGPT API for generating response.
- Flask App as API for Request/Response model.
- AWS EC2 for deployment (24/7 running). 

## Steps

2. Open twilio console, register your whatsapp number. 
3. Create Flask App.
4. Launch EC2 in AWS.
5. Install requirements in EC2.
6. Setup credentials(OpenAI and Ngrok) in EC2.
7. Run Flask App in EC2.
8. Run Ngrok on same port as Flask App. 
9. Setup Ngrok URL in Whatsapp Sandbox (in Twilio console).
10. Done, chatbot is activated!!
